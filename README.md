# Decision-making and control with diffractive optical networks

### Introduction
We propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical networks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such networks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily implemented with existing optical devices.
